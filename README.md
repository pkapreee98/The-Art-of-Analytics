# The-Art-of-Analytics
Leveraged NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis. Proficient in imputation, IQR-based outlier detection, one-hot encoding. Applied Linear, Lasso, Ridge regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes for predictive modeling. Merged stats with ML for insightful conclusions from complex data.

## Linear, Lasso and Ridge Regression models:

### Applied Linear Regression to the "Boston Housing" dataset, adeptly managing data partitioning for training and testing. Skillfully trained the model, made predictions, and meticulously gauged performance through Mean Squared Error (MSE) computation.
### Demonstrated prowess in Lasso Regression using the "Diabetes" dataset. Expertly partitioned data based on roll number and executed Lasso regression training with an alpha value of 0.1, adopting my first name as the model's name. Evaluated model accuracy by assessing MSE and discerned pivotal features through non-zero coefficients.
### Showcased a comprehensive approach by tackling the "California Housing" dataset. Navigated intricate preprocessing tasks like handling missing values and scaling features. Leveraged a prime or non-prime roll number criterion to effectively partition data for training and testing. Skillfully trained Ridge Regression, incorporating an alpha value of 0.01. Gauged model efficiency via MSE computation, reflecting a holistic understanding of data manipulation, preprocessing, and advanced regression modeling.

## Gaussian Naive Bayes model:

###  Undertook an intricate project centered around Gaussian Naive Bayes for Titanic survival prediction. Employed scikit-learn to implement the classifier, resolving missing values through mean imputation. Utilized one-hot encoding for 'Age' and 'Embarked' categorical features. 
### Leveraged a train-test split ratio of 74:26 based on my roll number (22103040). Trained the classifier, executed predictions, and quantified performance via a confusion matrix heatmap. Successfully visualized results with annotations, delivering comprehensive insights into predictive accuracy. This project underscores my proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and data visualization.
